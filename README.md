# Surfs-Up

## Purpose: 
The purpose of the Surfs-Up project is to provide our customer analysis of temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii for the months of June and December. Analysis results will support our customer gaining insight to determinining the sustainability of a surf shop year round in Oahu. 


## Results: 
Statitical analysis for temperatures in the months of June and December shown in this report are sourced from a weather database related to Hawaii. The database contains 19,550 records ranging from 2010-2017. Extracted from the database were temperatures for the two months to be compared. Results of the two months are reflective of more than 1500 temps (June, n=1700; December, n=1517). The images below provide statistical analysis for each month.

Comparing the two months our analysis shows that temperatures for the two months will be similar, with average temps in June slightly higher than the average temp in December. Minimum temps in for each month will range in the low 60's to mid 50's. Maximum temps will range in the low to mid 80's. 

Knowing the average, minimum and maximum temperatures is helpful with business planning. However, it may not provide enough comparison. Our customer may find it challenging to fully understand weather factors without conducting precipitation and wave measurements for the two months. This information will be vital to predicting success of a surf shop. 

## Summary: 
The data set used for this project included precipitation data and to support the research we added precipitation data to this analysis.

Adding the preciptiation analysis does not suggest preciptitation to be a concern with minimum preciptiation at 0 and maximum precipitation ranging from 4-6 inches of rain during the month. 

Our analysis suggests that weather will not be a deterent to the success of the surf shop. To further the analysis, our customer may want to consider researching wave measurements for the two months being compared.
