# Surfs-Up

## Purpose: 
The purpose of the Surfs-Up project is to provide our customer analysis of temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii for the months of June and December. Analysis results will support our customer gaining insight into the sustainability of a surf shop year round in Oahu. 


## Results: 
Statitical analysis for temperatures in the months of June and December shown in this report are sourced from a weather database related to Hawaii. The database contains 19,550 records from years 2010-2017. Extracted from the database were temperatures for the two months to be compared. Results of the two months are reflective of more than 1500 temps (June, n=1700; December, n=1517). The images below provide statistical analysis for each month.

Comparing the two months our analysis shows that temperatures for the two months will be similar, with average temps in June slightly higher than the average temp in December. Minimum temps in for each month will range in the low 60's to mid 50's. Maximum temps will range in the low to mid 80's. 

Knowing the average, minimum and maximum temperatures is helpful with business planning. However, it may not provide enough comparison to determine the factor weather will impose on the success of the surf shop. Our customer may find it challenging to fully understand weather factors without comparing precipitation measurements for the two months. Below is a preciptiation comparison for June and December.

Three key differences in weather between June and December that can be noted: 
  - Average temperatures are slightly higher in June than in December. 
  - Average precipitation is higher in December than in June. 
  - Minimum temps reported are 8 degrees lower in December than in June while maximum temps only vary by 2 degrees, with lower temps reported in December. 

Additionally, our customer may want to know the the average number of days per month and times of day that it rains. This information could be very useful in determining weather's factor in the success of the surf shop. 

## Summary: 
Based on analysis preformed in this report, our research indicates that weather will not negatively impact the success of the surf shop. However, further analysis may be required to determine number of days of rainfall in each month compared.
